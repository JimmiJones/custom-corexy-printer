CoreXY Printer Build State Summary (Yakima Total Care custom build)
This is a custom CoreXY printer with ~350×350×~400 build volume, using 400mm MGN12 Y rails and a 400mm X rail mounted below SendCutSend XY interface plates to lower the belt plane. Motion uses stacked high/low 9mm GT2 belts with 5mm bore idlers and pulleys, including both smooth and toothed idlers mounted on precision 5mm shafts or shoulder bolts. Corner idlers and X-gantry idlers will be vertically stacked, with belt heights defined by the X-gantry interface plates. Frame is 2060/2080 extrusion and already assembled square and stiff. Electronics use BTT Manta M5P with CB1 and CANBUS toolhead, plus Manta EZ3 dedicated to quad Z steppers. Bed will be large-format aluminum (~8mm MIC6 preferred) driven by four independent Z screws with Klipper leveling. Heater will be 110V AC silicone heater with SSR controlled via 24V logic. Design priority is maximum stiffness, precise belt alignment, and clean belt geometry derived from X-gantry datum height.
